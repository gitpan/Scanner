x Pod documentation section needs a clean up pass to bring it in line with
  my current standards.
  (I satisfied this requirement when I did a formatting a week or two ago.)

x Someone is working on a paper type class Paper::Spec. It may have all the
  properties I need. Keep an eye on it to see when it matures enough to be
  useable.
  (It is definitely useable at this point. I will have to create my
   own debian package though.)
  [DMA 20060615-20080818]

x I should not 'die' inside an object, but should fail and let the caller
  decide.
  (All have been replaced by Fault::ErrorHandler->warn and undef returns)

x Need a better place/way of creating the tmp.pnm file.
  (If I understand what I intended by this note, I have done it since
   I am using full pathnames instead of chdir now.)

x In pagetitle method, how do I handle the 'p' that goes before a pageid?
  (I think the full meaning of this note is lost in the sands of time. 
   Currently the code in that method does this:
	($pageid = "p" . $pageid) if ($pageid);
   to handle it. Hope that is what I meant.)

x I need to consolidate libdocument and possibly libfile-spec before
  I set up Defaults in the debian/control file.
  (This is definitely the case now, so I can go ahead and do it any time.)
  [DMA 20080807 - 20080828]

x Modify Job->new to take format as P:8.5x13.
  (Pretty much all done with this.)
  [DMA 20080818 - 20080822]

	x I need to do validity checking on this.
	  (Pretty much all done with this.)
