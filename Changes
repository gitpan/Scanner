libscanner-perl (0.02-3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Thu, 21 Aug 2008 02:01:45 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.02-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split Page into Page and Format classes. Changed code to
    create format objects from a format string "L:10x12" for
    example and pass around that information in a Format object.
    Also added SCANNER_AUTO_SHUTDOWN environment variable support.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Tue, 19 Aug 2008 19:27:46 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

libscanner-perl (0.01-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a dumb mistake. I did not type in the full conditional
    for the DEBUG that I tested, I only had the if defined part.
    I have added the if DEBUG true part now.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Sun, 20 Jan 2008 18:29:00 +0000

libscanner-perl (0.01-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added $::DEBUG global so that diagnostic print of the generated
    scan command line may be turned on if needed.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Sun, 20 Jan 2008 17:02:56 +0000

libscanner-perl (0.01-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for hp5590 scanner. It cannot do 150dpi, only
    100,200,300,600,1200,2400dpi are valid.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Sun,  6 May 2007 14:25:46 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now uses $SCANNER Environment variable contents, if
    defined, as the default scanner string.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Tue,  1 May 2007 14:18:25 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove erroneous perl build pre-depends from control file.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Sat,  2 Sep 2006 00:08:29 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now sets the environment variable required by the Mustek.
    Handles shutdown of the Mustek to turn off the lamp.
    Fixes a bug that prevented the use of ampersand in a file
    name. Bug occurred at the system call of convert.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Tue,  4 Jul 2006 20:36:19 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * I finally got around to fixing the Mustek scanner problem. It does
    not support the scanimage --source arg, so I created a page source
    of "NotApplicable" which suppresses use of --source. For the gt68xx
    this will over ride any setting the user might make.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Sun, 16 Apr 2006 19:15:30 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Umax uses flatbed where hp used normal. I generalized
    _setPageSource to convert one to the other depending on
    the type, hp or umax. Type is now parsed from the scanner
    string by _setScanner. Also fixed some minor bugs in
    the mostly unused default*****Is class methods.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Thu, 25 Aug 2005 20:57:16 +0100

libscanner-perl (0.01-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for a modifiable dpi value. Default is still 150 dpi.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Sun, 10 Jul 2005 19:56:00 -0400

libscanner-perl (0.01-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for specifiying the scanner device and
    page source. I can now use automatic document feeder
    for those scanners which support it.
  * It does not yet actually check validity on scanner
    device or page source string.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Sun, 26 Jun 2005 21:39:56 -0400

libscanner-perl (0.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started signing packages again.
  * Two steps back: scanimage no longer supports generalized 
    resolution and colour depth settings. I've temporarily
    hardwired this package to only work with UMAX.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Mon, 28 Feb 2005 13:54:03 +0000
