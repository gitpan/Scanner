=================
General

- Set up Defaults in the debian/control file.
  [DMA 20080807 - ?]

- Use ($$) arg templates in all functions
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

- Use argument fault checks all exported functions
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

=================
Device

- I will have to regeneralize since scanimage has dropped high level support
  for res, colour depth, etc. I should discuss this with the people on the
  SANE developer list. Without a means of polling the current scanner, there
  is no way to accurately validate values I am setting.
  [DMA 20080120-?]

	- There really is no choice but to parse the scanimage output
          on a device. 
          [DMA 20080828 - ?]

- Fully impliment the _validateScanner, _validatePageSource and _validateDpi 
  stub methods.
  [DMA 20080120-?]
	- I should have a way to detect if I have a valid device name, that it
	  exists on/is reachable by this machine and is on line and ready to
	  scan.
	  [DMA 20080120-?]

- May want to log a warning if a page dimensions exceed the scan bed size.
  [DMA 20080120-?]

	- I need to check the sizes against what scanimage allows, or
	  else report the failed size back to the user.
	  [DMA 20080827 - ?]


- Need to catch and retry cases where attempts are made to scan another page
  before the scanner is ready for it:
	scanimage: no SANE devices found
	convert: Not a PNM image file (tmp.pnm).
  [DMA 20080120-?]

- There are many similarities between the routines in _set*,_validate* and
  default* routines so one could probably simplify the code with a
  master routine for each group and called by the others.
  [DMA 20080120-?]

- Need a quick test for whether a scanner is valid or not.
  [DMA 20070514-?]

	- Can test for a scanner using
	   lsusb (as root) helps in finding where a usb scanner is
	   so you can use the "hp:libusb:001:019" format.
	  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

	- ARCHIVIST: Scanner class should scanimage to get a list of 
	  available scanners for selection
	  [DMA VERYOLD - ?]

- Should job control the turn of of the lamp? I think so.
  [DMA 20080825 - ?]

- Internal validation of scanner, page source and dpi strings is unimplimented 
  at this time.
  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

- I only support a few scanners, ones I have worked with, and those 
  incompletely. 
  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

- HP5590 sane backend ADF does not work properly. It scans a page and ejects
  the following two.
  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

- Mustek A3 sane backend has a source option that is disabled. I have
  not found a way to enable it.
  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

- There are other modes than Flatbed and ADF, but those are all I am 
  supporting at the moment. My wish is for a better Perl programmer 
  interface to SANE than attempting to work through the scanimage CLI.
  [DMA 20080817 - ? ]

- ARCHIVIST: speeding up the Mustek scanner
	- why didn't the compile work?
	- is depth=12 12b colour output worth using?
  [DMA VERYOLD - ?]

=================
Page

- The Page class was written with some misunderstanding of how page names
  are used in documents and especially in .toc objects. 
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

- add arg Fault isa check to _setFormat to confirm Scanner::Format obj
  [DMA 20040818 - ?]    

=================
Format

- Create a debian package of Paper::Specs.
  [DMA 20080818 - ?]

	- I can possibly work with dh_make_perl to automatically
	  down load and package it.

	- Use Paper::Spec to handle all the info about paper sizes and such.
	  [DMA 20080818 - ?]

	- Use Paper::Spec for defaultPaperTypeIs setup
	  [DMA 20060615 - ?}

	- Replace _paperSpects with Paper::Specs
	  [DMA 20060615 - ?}

=================
Job

- ARCHIVIST: need to set batch size based on how many pages
  there are, not just a number. If I start autoscan late,
  I could scan for more pages than there are!
  [DMA 20070511-?]

- When I get smarter code I will want to check the proposed batch size against
  the sheet count of the document and the number scanned so far and decide
  when we are at the end. Or I could allow for keeping a batch count and just
  reloading the hopper. This will happen in setBatchLength. I might then use
  a batchcnt that gets reset from batchlen when a new batch is started.
  [DMA 20070511-?]

- In nextPageNumbers, if someone types in pages which are not sequential in one
  of the formats, the next increment will get things wrong.
  [DMA 20070511-?]

- setBatchLength. Should test for non-numeric.
  [DMA 20070511-?]

- Can I make this handle single page non-document scans also?
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

- I should modify all the setPageTitles. That should be held in the Page object
  and passed to the document file as needed.
  [DMA 20080828 - ?]

- Should job control the turn of of the lamp? I think so.
  [DMA 20080825 - ?]
